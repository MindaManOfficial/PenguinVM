# PenguinVM
A Virtual Machine created in PenguinMod and with ScratchBlocks. 
(PENGUINVM IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH PENGUINMOD, ITS DEVELOPERS, OR SERVICE AS A WHOLE. THIS IS JUST A PROJECT CREATED ON AND BRANDED AROUND PENGUINMOD.)

You are installing the PenguinMod Installer. You do not need to do anything except configure your installations. All of the sprites will be downloaded

DO NOT RUN PenguinVM THAT ISN'T FROM www.sites.google.com/view/penguinvm OR MY OFFICIAL GITHUB PAGE! PenguinVM isn't perfect and can be laced with something malicious. Look for the checkmark by the bootloader name if you aren't sure. (This isn't a perfect method so just redownload it if you need to)

I have always wanted to make an OS in Scratch Code but now I am making 3 (i plan to) with a resemblance to a Linux Terminal, Windows 95, Windows 10 and a BIOS. I also plan on adding a thing called Scratchy Language which is Scratch Code but in a typing form. You would be able to create programs with software in PenguinVM and upload it to the Marketplaces on the 2 OS's (im excluding the terminal OS (BitShellâ‰¥)). They will have different compatibilities and other cool things to make it more realistic. This project is also pen-based. I made the entire challenge of this to be that I cannot use sprites as my assets and I would be forced to use pen. I do not plan on leaving this for a long time. If you want to help develop this, just contact me via email: mindaofficial01@gmail.com or "mindaman" on discord and I will get back to you! 

Default administrator password: admin
This password can be changed in the BIOS and in all of the OSs. They all have separate admininstrator passwords.

Recommendations

- Decent hardware. (This is a resource intensive experience)
- (If in Scratch) Play in mini mode. NOT FULLSCREEN (I have no idea why but the VM works way better in minimode than in full screen)
- Report buggy behavior
- This is open-source so do anything you want with this. Please don't take credit for my work!

unstable - usually applied for new features. Bug testing stage. Bugs are EXPECTED!! Please report any that you find!

stable - more reliable than unstable but still is getting bug tested

[blank] -official release

vision - preview (new items subject to change)

To see credits and resources used, use the "credits" cmd in any terminal
